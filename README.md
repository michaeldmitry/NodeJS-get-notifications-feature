# NodeJS-get-notifications-feature
This is a NodeJs webApp that makes use of the cordova and firestore notifcations feature. 
Basically, in another app that is not included in this repo, if a new user registers, a notifcation is sent to the users(admins) who have this admin app.
This is done by making use of the firestore functions and database functionalities as well as the cordova services to access cross mobile platforms' functionalities.

//NOTE
Any package-lock.json files are removed as well as any info about the database inside the code for security reasons. So, the app won't work if installed as it as.
